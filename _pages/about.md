I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Michigan's Robotics Institute](http://robotics.umich.edu) investigating methods for processing trust between drivers and robotic vehicles. My research interests include, but are not limited to: Human-Robot Interaction, Machine Learning and Control of Dynamic Systems (in particular, autonomous and semi-autonomous ground vehicles).
I work with Professors [Dawn Tilbury](https://me.engin.umich.edu/people/faculty/dawn-tilbury) and [Lionel Robert](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/lionel-robert) in the [MAVRIC Lab](https://mavric.si.umich.edu/).

I have received a B.S. in Electronics Engineering from the [Military Institute of Engineering](http://www.ime.eb.mil.br/en/) and a M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from the [Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro](http://www.puc-rio.br/english/), where I worked with Professor [Marco Meggiolaro](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8_LP4XYAAAAJ&hl=en).
